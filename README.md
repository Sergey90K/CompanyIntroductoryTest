Introductory test task to the company ********
The task is as follows:

We are given a file with a large set of integers (the file can be downloaded from **************************).

Your task is to find the following four/six values:
    1. the maximum number in the file;
    2. the minimum number in the file;
    3. the median;
    4. the arithmetic mean;
    5*. the largest sequence of numbers (following each other) that is increasing (optional)
    6*. the largest sequence of numbers (following each other), which is decreasing (optional)

The proposed solution method should find all four/six values from the file in no more than 90 seconds. This condition is optional, but it will be a significant advantage if your solution meets it.
